Smart Task Planner

Objective:
	Smart Task Planner is an AI-powered application that breaks down user goals into actionable tasks with timelines, dependencies, and milestones. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate logical and structured plans for achieving goals efficiently.

Scope of Work:
	Input: Goal text (e.g., “Launch a product in 2 weeks”)  
	Output: Detailed task breakdown, dependencies, estimated timelines  
	Frontend: Optional Streamlit app to submit goals and view generated plans  

 Technical Expectations:
	Backend API: Processes user input and generates actionable plans  
	Optional Database: For storing tasks and progress  
	LLM Integration: Uses Gemini API via `google.generativeai` for reasoning and task generation  
	Prompt Engineering: Structured prompts guide the LLM to produce clear, actionable plans
